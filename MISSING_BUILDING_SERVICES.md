## Recommendations:

### Option 1: Single "Small Build Services" Page
Create `/joinery-services/small-build-services` covering:
- Extensions
- Renovations & Refurbishments
- Small Construction Projects
- Maintenance Work
- General Building Work

### Option 2: Separate Pages (Better for SEO)
Create individual pages:
- `/joinery-services/extensions`
- `/joinery-services/renovations`
- `/joinery-services/small-build-projects`
- `/joinery-services/building-maintenance`

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
- Main page: `/joinery-services/small-build-services` (overview)
- Sub-pages for high-value services:
  - `/joinery-services/extensions`
  - `/joinery-services/renovations`

## SEO Impact:

**Current Problem:**
- Homepage promises "Small Build Works" but no page exists
- Users searching for "extensions York" or "renovations Yorkshire" won't find dedicated content
- Missing keyword opportunities for building-related searches
- Inconsistent messaging (promised but not delivered)

**Benefits of Adding Pages:**
- Capture "extension" and "renovation" search traffic
- Better match user intent when they search for building services
- Complete the service offering as promised
- Improve local SEO for building-related queries
- Geo-targeting opportunities (e.g., "extensions in York")

## Next Steps:

1. **Decide on structure** (single page vs multiple pages)
2. **Create content** for building services
3. **Add to navigation** (navbar, services list)
4. **Update sitemap** to include new pages
5. **Add location-specific pages** (e.g., `/joinery-services/york-extensions`)
6. **Update homepage** to link to new pages
7. **Update About page** to link to new pages
