              I’ve been fitting doors for years — from single internal doors to
              full fire door packages. If you're after reliable, tidy work and
              someone who turns up when they say they will, you're in the right
              place. I work with all kinds of doors: wood, metal, composite,
              even UPVC — and I’ll help make sure what you choose is right for
              your space and needs.
              <br />

              It’s not just about hanging a door — it’s about doing it right. As
              a fully qualified joiner, I make sure your doors are fitted
              properly the first time, avoiding the common problems you get with
              poor installs: draughts, sticking doors, uneven gaps, or unsafe
              fittings. When you hire someone trained and certified, you're
              investing in a job that lasts.

              What Makes Us Different
            </h2>
            <p>
              A lot of people can hang a door — but only a qualified joiner
              knows how to do it to a professional standard. From fire doors to
              high-traffic internal doors, my training and experience mean I
              spot and avoid the issues that lead to faults later on.
            </p>
            <p>
              We take extra care in everything we do — not just the joinery
              itself, but how we work around your home or site. Every task area
              is fully protected before we start, and we make sure everything is
              thoroughly cleaned afterwards.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once the work is complete, we don’t just pack up and go. We’ll
              walk you through everything we’ve done, demonstrate the work so
              you can see it in action, and ask you to sign off once you’re
              happy. We’ll also provide a handover form for your records — it’s
              all part of how we work.
            </p>
            <p>
              These small steps add up to something big: confidence. When you
              hire us, you’re hiring a team that cares about the detail, the
              finish, and your experience as a customer.
