                  I've been fitting kitchens for over 30 years {locationInText}, and I still love the craft. 
                  When you work with me, you're dealing directly with me — no sales team, no middlemen. 
                  I'll measure up, talk through what you need, and then get on with fitting it properly. 
                  Simple as that.

                  I fit kitchens in all sorts of places — your home, rental properties, offices, even the odd commercial kitchen. 
                  Over the years I've done everything from single domestic fits to multi-unit developments and trade work. 
                  The approach is always the same: measure carefully, fit precisely, finish properly.

                      new builds with open-plan layouts, everything in between. I'll always take the time to understand 
                      how you're going to use the space, then fit it accordingly. A kitchen that looks right and works right.

                  I'm happy to chat through options and help you choose something that'll work well for your space and budget.
