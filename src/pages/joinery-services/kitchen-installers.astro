          I’m Robert, the owner and joiner behind Coulsy Joinery. When you work
          with me, you’re getting more than a kitchen fitter — you’re getting
          personal, expert service from the first conversation to the final
          handover.

        <p class="text-gray-700 text-base">
          Whether you're in need of a local kitchen fitter, a full kitchen
          renovation, or a professional joiner to install trade-supplied
          kitchens from Howdens or Magnet – I'm here to deliver high quality,
          efficient, and reliable service every time.

              Kitchen Fitting with a Personal Touch
            </h2>
            <p>
              As a skilled joiner, I take care of every stage — from measuring
              and planning through to a clean, precise installation. No sales
              teams, no subcontractors — just honest work done right.

              What We Offer
            </h2>
            <p>
              Whether you need a single kitchen fit or full installations across
              multiple units, I bring the same care and expertise to each
              project. Domestic or commercial, every kitchen is fitted with
              quality and pride.
            </p>
            <p>
              I supply and fit kitchens from leading trade names such as
              Howdens, Magnet, and DIY Kitchens. Whether you've already chosen
              your kitchen or need guidance selecting the right setup, I’ll help
              ensure every detail is covered — from measuring to final
              installation. My reputation as a local kitchen fitter is built on
              trust, tidy work, and a reliable finish.
