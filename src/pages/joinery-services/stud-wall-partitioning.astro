            One of the services that we provide {
              location ? "in " + locationFormated : ""
            } is expert timber stud wall partitioning errecting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Timber stud wall partitioning is building a wooden framed wall using
            timber studs that are secured to the floor and the ceiling of an
            existing structure.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each stud is part of the larger frame and is attached to both the
            sole plate and the top plate wood.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is re-enforced by staggered blocking across the wall between
            each stud, with headers or gaps for doorways and existing load
            bearing beams.
          </p>
          <h2 class="font-semibold text-lg">Dependable</h2>
          <p>

            Coulsy to build some stud wall partitioning in your home is much
            more affordable than buying a new home.
