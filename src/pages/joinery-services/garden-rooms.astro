            Hi, I’m Robert — a time-served joiner with over three decades of
            hands-on experience. I really enjoy building garden rooms {
              locationInText
            } — they’re a great way to bring the comfort of indoors outside, and
            every one I build is tailored to the person who’s going to use it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether you want a quiet place to unwind, a creative workspace, or
            somewhere to enjoy time with friends and family, I’ll help you shape
            a space that fits naturally with your garden and lifestyle {
              locationInText
            }.
          </p>
          <p>
            I take care of the whole process — from early ideas and sketches
            through to the final touches, right here {locationInText}. Whether
            you're after a home studio, a reading nook, or just your own
            peaceful escape, I’ll build something with genuine care and
            craftsmanship.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you’ve already got plans or a design in mind, I’m happy to work
            with them — or we can start with a rough idea and shape things
            together. Either way, we’ll end up with something that feels just
            right for you.
          </p>

            Tailored Designs for Every Lifestyle
          </h3>
          <p>
            Each garden room we build is customised to suit your personal tastes
            and requirements. From modern aesthetics to classic charm, your new
            space will enhance your garden and daily life {locationInText}.

            Built for Comfort and Efficiency
          </h3>
          <p>
            I build garden rooms that feel good to use all year round — warm in
            winter, cool in summer — using proper materials like insulated
            timber frames and breathable membranes to make them energy efficient
            and long-lasting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether you prefer traditional cladding or sleek finishes, your
            garden room is crafted for durability and long-term enjoyment. Plus,
            a well-designed garden room can add significant value to your
            property {locationInText}.
          </p>
          <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg">Exceptional Craftsmanship</h3>
          <p>
            I only use good-quality materials and I don’t cut corners — every
            project {locationInText} gets my full attention. It matters to me that
            your garden room feels solid, looks great, and lasts for years.
          </p>
          <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg">Eco-Friendly Options</h3>
          <p>
            If sustainability’s important to you, I can suggest greener options
            too — whether it’s using FSC-certified timber, breathable materials,
            or low-impact insulation.
          </p>
          <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg">Local Knowledge and Expertise</h3>
          <p>
            Being based near York, I know the local style and what works best in
            different settings — whether your garden room needs to blend in or
            stand out.

            Planning & Regulations — What You Should Know
          </h3>
          <p>
            Many garden rooms can be constructed without planning permission
            under permitted development rights, but certain guidelines apply.
            Typically, your garden room should not exceed 2.5m in height if
            within 2 metres of a boundary, and total height limits are 4m for
            pitched roofs or 3m for flat roofs. The structure must be located
            behind your home, not in front of the main elevation.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your property is in a conservation area, an Area of Outstanding
            Natural Beauty (AONB), or is listed, additional rules may apply. I’m
            happy to provide advice tailored to your site.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if planning permission is not required, Building Regulations
            may still apply—especially if the garden room is over 15m², used for
            sleeping, or includes electrical or plumbing installations. I always
            ensure compliance with relevant standards for insulation,
            ventilation, and safety.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you intend to use the garden room for business purposes involving
            customers or deliveries, local planning authority approval may be
            necessary. For quiet home use, this is usually not an issue.
