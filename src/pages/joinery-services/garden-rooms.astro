            Planning & Regulations — What You Should Know
          </h3>
          <p>
            Many garden rooms can be constructed without planning permission
            under permitted development rights, but certain guidelines apply.
            Typically, your garden room should not exceed 2.5m in height if
            within 2 metres of a boundary, and total height limits are 4m for
            pitched roofs or 3m for flat roofs. The structure must be located
            behind your home, not in front of the main elevation.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your property is in a conservation area, an Area of Outstanding
            Natural Beauty (AONB), or is listed, additional rules may apply. I’m
            happy to provide advice tailored to your site.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if planning permission is not required, Building Regulations
            may still apply—especially if the garden room is over 15m², used for
            sleeping, or includes electrical or plumbing installations. I always
            ensure compliance with relevant standards for insulation,
            ventilation, and safety.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you intend to use the garden room for business purposes involving
            customers or deliveries, local planning authority approval may be
            necessary. For quiet home use, this is usually not an issue.
