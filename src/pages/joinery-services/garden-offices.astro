          <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg">Custom Designs</h3>
          <p>
            Every garden office we create is tailored to your specific needs and
            preferences. From contemporary designs to classic styles, we ensure
            your new space complements your garden and lifestyle.
          </p>
          <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg">Engineered for Performance</h3>
          <p>
            Our garden offices aren't just good looking — they're built to
            perform. We use high-performance wall systems with insulated timber
            frames and breathable membranes, finished to suit your style. These
            structures meet or exceed modern thermal efficiency expectations,
            keeping you warm in winter and cool in summer — with lower energy
            costs, too.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether you choose traditional cladding or contemporary finishes,
            your new garden office is crafted for year-round use and long-term
            durability. Plus, a well-built garden office can significantly boost
            your property’s value by adding premium, versatile space with strong
            aesthetic appeal.
          </p>
          <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg">Quality Craftsmanship</h3>
          <p>
            I use only the finest materials and cutting-edge construction
            techniques to ensure long-term durability and all-season comfort.
            Unlike some, I don’t cut corners or compromise on quality — I choose
            premium-grade materials because it matters. That might not make us
            the cheapest option, but it ensures your garden office is built to
            the highest standards, with no shortcuts.
          </p>
          <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg">Sustainable Solutions</h3>

            Rules & Regulations — What You Need to Know
          </h3>
          <p>
            Most garden offices can be built without planning permission thanks
            to permitted development rights, but there are important rules to
            keep in mind. In general, your garden office must be no taller than
            2.5m if it’s within 2 metres of a boundary, and the total height
            should not exceed 4m for pitched roofs or 3m for flat roofs. It must
            be located behind your home—not in front of the principal elevation.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you live in a conservation area, an Area of Outstanding Natural
            Beauty (AONB), or in a listed property, additional restrictions may
            apply. I’m happy to advise you based on your site and layout.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if planning isn’t needed, certain features may trigger Building
            Regulations—for example, if the office is over 15m², used for
            sleeping, or includes electrics or plumbing. While small offices are
            often exempt, I always build to meet or exceed Building Regulation
            standards where relevant, including proper insulation, ventilation,
            and electrical safety.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you're planning to use the space for business, and it involves
            regular customers or deliveries, we’ll need to check with your local
            planning authority. For quiet home working, you’re usually fine.
