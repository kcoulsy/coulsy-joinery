            If you're planning a roof structure and need a reliable team to
            erect your trusses {locationInText}, I’d be happy to help. I’m
            Robert — a time-served joiner with decades of hands-on experience in
            structural joinery and truss roof installs.
          </p>
          <p>
            I work closely with builders, developers, and private clients to
            deliver well-fitted, regulation-compliant truss roofs on everything
            from home extensions and attic conversions to full new builds and
            commercial units.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether you need attic trusses, raised tie trusses, or a full
            prefabricated roof system — I make sure everything is properly
            aligned, securely fixed, and completed with care.
          </p>

            cleanLocationName && (
              <p>
                I’ve worked on truss roof installations across{" "}
                {cleanLocationName}, adapting each job to the site layout, truss
                design, and build sequence. Whether it’s a residential extension
                or a large-span commercial unit, I make sure the install is
                accurate, tidy, and aligned with the build programme.
              </p>
            )
          }
          <p>
            I hold the relevant CSCS card and work alongside trusted colleagues
            to handle both domestic and commercial-scale truss roof projects {
              locationInText
            }. Safety, tidiness, and clear communication are all part of the
            service.
          </p>

            safely and accurately, just <a
