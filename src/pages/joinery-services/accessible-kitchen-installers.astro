            <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-700">
              Hi, I’m Robert — a time-served joiner with over 30 years of
              experience. I help people create kitchens that are safer, easier
              to use, and tailored to support their independence. Whether you’re
              adapting your space after a life change or planning ahead, I’ll
              work with you every step of the way to create something that works
              beautifully and practically for you.
            </p>
            <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-700">
              I don’t believe accessible kitchens should feel clinical — they
              should feel like home. From lowered counters to soft-close
              pull-outs, and from touchless taps to smart adjustments,
              everything is made with comfort, dignity, and daily ease in mind.
            </p>
            <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-700">
              Every accessible kitchen I build {locationInText} is unique. We’ll
              talk through what you need, what’s getting in your way, and how we
              can design around that — whether it’s mobility challenges, seated use,
              or future-proofing your home.
            </p>
            <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-700">
              I work directly with you — no sales team, no middlemen. Just
              honest advice and skilled joinery, delivered with care.
            </p>
            <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-700">
              If you’re based {locationInText} and looking for someone who understands
              how to balance form, function, and accessibility — I’d love to help.
              Just drop me a message and I’ll be happy to chat through your ideas.
            </p>
