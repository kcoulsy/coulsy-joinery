          Creating an accessible kitchen isn’t just about compliance — it’s

              Accessible Kitchens Designed Around You {locationInText}
            </h2>
            <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-700">
              Hi, I’m Robert — an experienced joiner with over 30 years of
              hands-on work in homes across {locationInText || "your area"}. I
              design and install accessible kitchens that prioritise ease of
              use, comfort, and independent living. Whether you need a kitchen
              adapted after an injury, or you’re planning ahead to make life
              easier, I’ll help bring your ideas to life with practical design
              and trusted craftsmanship.
            </p>
            <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-700">
              I don’t believe accessible kitchens should feel clinical — they
              should feel like home. From lowered counters to soft-close
              pull-outs, and from touchless taps to smart adjustments,
              everything is made with comfort, dignity, and daily ease in mind.
            </p>
            {
              cleanLocationName && (
                <p>
                  {cleanLocationName} is home to a variety of property styles
                  and layouts — from compact modern kitchens to larger family
                  spaces. Every accessible kitchen I fit is adapted to meet the
                  unique constraints and opportunities of that home. Whether
                  it's working around tight spaces, varying floor levels, or
                  older fittings, I bring experience and problem-solving to help
                  make everyday tasks easier.
                </p>
              )
            }
            <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-700">
              I work directly with you — no sales team, no middlemen. Just
              honest advice and skilled joinery, delivered with care.
            </p>
            <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-700">
              If you’re thinking about making your kitchen more accessible —
              whether for now or for the future — let’s chat. I’ll listen to
              what matters most to you and offer honest, practical advice based
              on years of joinery experience {locationInText || "locally"}. No
              pressure, no pushy sales — just support from someone who’s here to
              help.
