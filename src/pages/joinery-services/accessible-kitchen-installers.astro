          Creating an accessible kitchen isn’t just about compliance — it’s
          about dignity, ease, and everyday living. I’m Robert, and I specialise
          in building kitchens that are tailored around your needs and
          lifestyle. From first ideas to final touches, I handle every part of

              Accessible Kitchens Designed Around You {locationInText}
            </h2>
            <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-700">
              Hi, I’m Robert — an experienced joiner with over 30 years of
              hands-on work in homes across {locationInText || "your area"}. I
              design and install accessible kitchens that prioritise ease of
              use, comfort, and independent living. Whether you need a kitchen
              adapted after an injury, or you’re planning ahead to make life
              easier, I’ll help bring your ideas to life with practical design
              and trusted craftsmanship.
            </p>
            <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-700">
              I don’t believe accessible kitchens should feel clinical — they
              should feel like home. From lowered counters to soft-close
              pull-outs, and from touchless taps to smart adjustments,
              everything is made with comfort, dignity, and daily ease in mind.
            </p>
            <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-700">
              Every accessible kitchen I build {
                locationInText || "in your local area"
              } is tailored around your needs — no two homes or challenges are the
              same. We’ll talk through what you need, what’s getting in your way,
              and how we can design around that — whether it’s mobility challenges,
              seated use, or future-proofing your home.
            </p>
            <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-700">
              I work directly with you — no sales team, no middlemen. Just
              honest advice and skilled joinery, delivered with care.
            </p>
            <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-700">
              If you’re thinking about making your kitchen more accessible —
              whether for now or for the future — let’s chat. I’ll listen to
              what matters most to you and offer honest, practical advice based
              on years of joinery experience {locationInText || "locally"}. No
              pressure, no pushy sales — just support from someone who’s here to
              help.
