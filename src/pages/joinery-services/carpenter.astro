          <p>
            Hi, I’m Robert — a time-served carpenter and joiner with over 30
            years of experience working on everything from new builds and
            extensions to restorations and roofing. I take pride in doing things
            properly — no shortcuts, no guesswork — just solid, reliable work.
            Whether you're after site carpentry, roof carcassing, or floor joist
            installation, I offer practical solutions tailored to each build.
          </p>

          <p>
            Carpentry is the backbone of any build. Whether it’s first fix stud
            walls, joists, roof structures, or floor systems, I make sure
            everything is measured, marked, and fixed with care. My work sets
            the standard for whatever follows — and I treat that responsibility
            seriously.
          </p>

          <p>
            I bring a mix of traditional skill and modern tools to every job.
            From cutting in rafters and installing trusses to prepping timber
            frames for cladding, it’s all about getting the structure right and
            leaving it neat, plumb, and ready for the next trade. I also work
            closely with builders and project managers to ensure timber frames
            are correctly aligned and set out from the start.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can also <a

              >what qualifications and experience I bring to the job</a
            >.
          </p>

          <p>
            I’m based in North Yorkshire and work in and around {
              locationInText.trim()
                ? locationInText.trim().replace(/^in\s*/, "")
                : "the surrounding area"
            }. If you’re looking for a dependable carpenter who turns up, gets
            stuck in, and delivers work that lasts — I’d be glad to help.
          </p>
