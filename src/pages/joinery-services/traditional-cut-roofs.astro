            If you’re considering a traditional cut roof {locationInText}, I’d
            be happy to help. I’m Robert — a time-served joiner with over 30
            years of hands-on experience in bespoke timber framing and roof
            construction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cut roofs give you more flexibility than trusses — especially for
            awkward layouts, vaulted ceilings, or future attic conversions. I
            build them the proper way using strong, well-sourced timber and a
            practical layout that suits your build.
          </p>
          <p>
            My team and I take care of everything from timber selection and
            design to precise onsite assembly. We don’t rely on mechanical
            handling where it’s not needed — so access issues or tight spaces {
              locationInText
            } are no problem.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Custom-built for your plans and elevations</li>
            <li>Solid timber from sustainable sources</li>
            <li>Great for adding Velux or dormers later on</li>
            <li>Delivered and built without heavy plant</li>
            <li>Ideal where headroom is tight or complex</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Whether you’re a homeowner, contractor, or architect {
              locationInText
            }, I work closely with your team to make sure the structure is spot
            on. No drama, no hassle — just a proper cut roof, built to last.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you’ve got plans you’d like me to take a look at or just want to
            run through an idea, feel free to <a
