          <h2 class="font-semibold text-lg">Traditional cut roof benefits</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>
              No need for mechanical means such as a tele-handler or crane to
              load out material (roof size dependent)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>Can create more room height on tighter buildings</li>
          <li>
            Can be tailored made to any roof shape and size no matter how
            complex
          </li>
          <li>Can later be adjusted to add Velux's and or dormers</li>
          <li>
            No need to worry about height restriction on access as all materials
            can be delivered on a flat bed
          </li>
