            Hi, I’m Robert — a time-served joiner with over 30 years of hands-on
            experience. I’ve worked across domestic, commercial, and heritage
            projects, and I still get great satisfaction from delivering proper,
            well-finished joinery the right way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether you need something unique crafting from scratch or a
            reliable installation service, I offer truly bespoke joinery{
              locationInText
            }. Every job is different, and that’s why I combine traditional
            carpentry techniques with modern tools and materials to make sure
            the results are spot on.
          </p>
          <p>
            I cover everything from first and second fix joinery to fine
            finishing work. That includes heritage restorations, sash windows,
            custom staircases, doors, skirtings, architraves, roofs, and
            shopfitting — all delivered with care and attention to detail.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m proud to be City & Guilds qualified, and I don’t cut corners. I
            use the right materials, prep carefully, and make sure each job is
            finished to a standard I’d be happy with in my own home.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also take pride in how I leave the job. You’ll find everything
            protected while I work, tidied up before I leave, and I’ll walk you
            through the results to make sure you’re 100% happy before signing
            off.
          </p>
