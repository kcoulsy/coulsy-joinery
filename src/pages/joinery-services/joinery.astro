          <p>
            With over 30 years of hands-on experience in carpentry and joinery,
            I’ve worked across domestic, commercial, and industrial projects. My
            aim is always to deliver truly bespoke joinery with top-quality
            craftsmanship.
          </p>
          <p>
            I offer tailor-made joinery products{locationInText}, available
            either for supply only or fully installed. Using a mix of
            traditional skills and modern techniques, I take pride in producing
            work that’s built to last.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm trained in both modern and traditional joinery methods —
            including 1st Fix, 2nd Fix, and Final Fix. I use the right tools
            like jigs and routers to ensure consistent quality and
            craftsmanship.
          </p>
          <p>
            I offer a full range of joinery services — from handmade pieces to
            high-quality products sourced from trusted suppliers. That includes
            doors, windows, staircases, skirtings, architraves, ironmongery
            fitting, traditional roofs, truss roofs, and shop fitting{
              locationInText
            }.
