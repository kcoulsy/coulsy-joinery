            <h3>We take safety seriously — for you and for us.</h3>
            <p>
              We’re not a big company, and we don’t pretend to be. It’s my
              experience and hands-on approach that allows us to go that one
              step further — making sure things are done properly, with care and
              attention that’s often missing from larger outfits.
            </p>
            <p>
              Health and safety isn’t a tick-box exercise for us — it’s about
              doing the job properly and protecting everyone involved. Whether
              you’re a property owner, landlord, site manager or just need work
              done at home, you can rely on us to meet the necessary safety and
              compliance standards.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you're responsible for a building or work environment, it's
              important to be aware of your duties under UK fire and safety law.
