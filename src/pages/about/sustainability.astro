          <p>
            We know construction and joinery work can have an impact on the
            environment — and we don’t take that lightly. That’s why we aim to
            reduce waste, reuse materials where possible, and make thoughtful
            choices every day on site.
          </p>

          <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg">
            Staying Within the Rules (and Going Beyond)
          </h3>
          <p>
            We meet all the environmental regulations that apply to our work.
            But we don’t just stop at the minimum. Where there isn’t a law or
            guideline in place, we use common sense and experience to do what’s
            right for the environment — and we keep a record of it.
          </p>

          <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg">Getting the Team Involved</h3>
          <p>
            Everyone we work with is part of this. We make sure our team
            understands the importance of working cleanly and efficiently — and
            we back that up with training, site discussions, and regular reviews
            of how we work.
          </p>

          <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg">Looking After People Too</h3>
          <p>
            Sustainability isn't just about the environment — it’s about people
            too. We actively promote wellbeing, health, and safety for our
            clients, team, and community through how we work and the choices we
            make.
